# Pig Game - React Version

This is a React conversion of the original JavaScript Pig Game. The game maintains the same functionality and visual design as the original, but is now built using React components and hooks.

## Game Rules

- Two players take turns rolling a dice
- Each roll adds to the current player's current score
- If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current score and the turn passes to the other player
- Players can choose to "Hold" their current score, adding it to their total score
- The first player to reach 100 points wins
